# Value Regime Change Cycle Animation Concept

## Overview
An animation visualizing historical value regime changes through the metaphor of "lenses" that highlight and affect different aspects of civilization. As lenses change (every ~250 years), different elements glow and grow/shrink based on their perceived value in that regime.

## Structure
Three layers representing:
1. Superstructure (ideological/cultural)
2. Social Structure (organizational/institutional)
3. Infrastructure (material/technological)

## Selected Historical Value Regimes

### 1. Indigenous/Nature-Based System (Pre-agricultural)
Characterized by deep integration with nature and gift economies

Superstructure:
- Sacred natural sites (glowing)
- Celestial bodies/patterns (glowing)
- Animal spirits/totems (glowing)

Social Structure:
- Tribal circles/gatherings (glowing)
- Gift exchange symbols (glowing)
- Ceremonial spaces

Infrastructure:
- Natural resources
- Seasonal paths/routes
- Traditional tools

### 2. Feudal System (800-1200 CE)
Characterized by land-based power and religious authority

Superstructure:
- Church/Cathedral (glowing)
- Religious symbols (glowing)
- Written texts/scrolls

Social Structure:
- Castle/Manor (glowing)
- Crown/nobility symbols (glowing)
- Peasant/farming symbols

Infrastructure:
- Land/fields
- Basic tools
- Water mill

### 3. Mercantile/Early Modern (1500-1700)
Characterized by trade networks and early capitalism

Superstructure:
- Scientific instruments (glowing)
- Books/printing press (glowing)
- Religious symbols (fading)

Social Structure:
- Merchant ships (glowing)
- Coins/money bags (glowing)
- Market squares (glowing)

Infrastructure:
- Trade routes
- Urban centers
- Workshops

### 4. Industrial Capitalism (1800-2000)
Characterized by mechanization and mass production

Superstructure:
- Stock market symbols (glowing)
- Corporate logos (glowing)
- Media symbols

Social Structure:
- Factory (glowing)
- Assembly line (glowing)
- Office buildings (glowing)

Infrastructure:
- Railways/transportation
- Power plants/energy
- Industrial machinery

## Animation Notes
- Each regime change shows a lens transition effect
- Glowing elements gradually grow/expand
- Non-valued elements slowly fade/shrink
- Maximum 9 elements visible at any time
- Clear visual distinction between the three layers
